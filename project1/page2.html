                <h3>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</h3> <br>
                <p>Boil the pasta:
                    Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water).</p> <br>
                <p>Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, stirring
                    occasionally,
                    about 9 to 11 minutes, until mostly cooked through but still a bit firm to the bite. </p> <br>
                <h3>Using a colander, drain and set to the side.
                </h3> <br>
                <p>Cook the ground beef:
                    As the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the ground beef. </p> <br>
                <p>Season with oregano, sea salt, black pepper, chili powder, and ground cumin. Cook, stirring
                    occasionally,
                    until the beef is browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
                </p> <br>
                <p>Add the butter and aromatics:
                    Add the butter, onions, garlic, and tomato puree to the skillet with the ground beef. Stir until all
                    ingredients are combined.
                </p> <br>
                <p>Combine the pasta and ground beef:
                    Add the cooked pasta to the beef mixture and stir to combine. Add the heavy whipping cream, chicken
                    stock, parsley, basil, 1 1/2 cups of the shredded Monterey Jack cheese, and 1 cup of the shredded
                    cheddar cheese. Stir until combined.
                </p> <br>
                <p>Add to a casserole dish:
                    Transfer to a 9x13-inch casserole dish (no need to grease) and top with the remaining cheese.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Bake:
                    Bake the casserole for 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is browned and bubbly.</p> <br>
                <p>Serve and store:
                    For a looser casserole, serve right away. For a casserole that holds its shape a bit, let sit 10
                    minutes
                    before serving. </p> <br>
                <p>The casserole will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for 3-4 days.</p> <br>
                <p>You can also freeze it by storing it in an airtight container for up to 3 months. To reheat,
                    microwave or
                    place in the oven at 350°F oven until it is heated through (this will depend on the portion size you
                    are
                    reheating).</p>
